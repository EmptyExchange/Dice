# Dice
Working on making a dice rolling game

5/9.. Making decent progress in getting the framework of the project set up. No issues with creating the dice and pips. No issue with the random number generator for rolling the dice. Now I need to figure out how to get each die to show the correct number of pips. I need to figure out how to add and remove pips as necessary. Maybe have all pips available for each die and hide/show the necessary pips to reflect the number rolled.
